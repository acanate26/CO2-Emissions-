# CO2 Emissions 
This project examines carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by fuel and sector in New York State for 2021, utilizing publicly available emissions data. The goal is to investigate which sectors and fuel types contribute most to emissions and conduct basic statistical comparisons across categories. Using this data, I also created a dashboard on Tableau https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arielle.canate/viz/CO2Emissions_17502956933870/Dashboard1, so feel free to check it out!

This is a couple of t-tests designed to understand the significant difference in emission inputs between common fuels: 

[Welch Two Sample t-test data value by fuel-name t = -0.21824, df = 8.881, p-value = 0.8322 alternative hypothesis true difference in means between group Natural Gas and group Petroleum is not equa.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21336036/Welch.Two.Sample.t-test.data.value.by.fuel-name.t.-0.21824.df.8.881.p-value.0.8322.alternative.hypothesis.true.difference.in.means.between.group.Natural.Gas.and.group.Petroleum.is.not.equa.pdf)

Then, this is a visualization of my findings for fuel increase in the state of New York:
